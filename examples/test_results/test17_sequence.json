  "baseline": "Here’s a comprehensive step-by-step plan based on the observed sequence:  \n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Pattern**  \nThe sequence provided is: **2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ...**  \n\n- Compare adjacent pairs:\n  - $6 - 2 = 4$\n  - $12 - 6 = 6$\n  - $20 - 12 = 8$\n  - $30 - 20 = 10$\n\nThis indicates that each term increases by **an additional even number**, starting at **4**: 4, 6, 8, 10,...\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Next Increment**  \nSince the gap between terms alternates between odd and even integers starting from 4, the next increment will continue this pattern:  \n\nNext gap = $12$  \nThus, the sixth term becomes:  \n$$ 30 + 12 = \\boxed{42} $$\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**  \nBased on the mathematical observation, the missing term following **30** is **42**, maintaining the increasing gap rule. This confirms the pattern of sequential addition where each successive value adds 2 more than the prior increment (i.e., 4, 6, 8,...).  \n\nFinal Answer: $\\boxed{42}$",
