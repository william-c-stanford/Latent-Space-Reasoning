  "latent_reasoning": "**Step-by-Step Plan for Recursive Algorithm Using Frame-Stewart**\n\n---\n\n### **1. Understanding the Problem**\nWe aim to write a recursive algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi with an additional fourth peg (**'Frame'**) while applying the **Frame-Stewart algorithm**, which accounts for overlapping movements.  \nThe goal is to compute the **minimum number of moves** required to solve the problem for $ n $ disks.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Conjectural Recurrence Relation**\n\nDefine $ F(n) $ as the minimum number of moves for $ n $ discs using **4 pegs**.  \n\nUsing geometric insights and properties of the Frame-Stewart algorithm:  \n$$\nF(n) < \\frac{5^n}{n}\n$$  \n**Why conjectural?**: Adding the fourth peg introduces opportunities to minimize redundant passes by avoiding conflicts between layers, effectively increasing the search space beyond 3.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Derivation of the Recurrence**\n\n#### Base Case:\nIf $ n = 0 $, no moves are needed (base case: $ F(0) = 0 $).\n\n#### General Case:\nWhen trying to move $ n $ discs, consider partitioning the set into two subsets: $ S_a $ and $ S_b $. Each subset requires $ F(a) + F(b) $ moves to complete their respective tasks. During the final merge phase, overlapping transitions (e.g., moving intermediate disks) can avoid unnecessary overhead. Thus, the recurrence becomes:\n\n$$\nF(n) = F\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) + F\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)\n+ K\n$$\n\nWhere $ K $ depends on the distribution of the large disc across the two subsets. After optimizing over overlaps, we simplify the recurrence:\n\n$$\nF(n) = 2F\\left(\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor\\right) + O(n^\\alpha)\n$$\n\nwhere $ \\alpha > 0 $ ensures efficient reduction in redundancy.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Closed-Form Solution**\n\nIntegrating the recurrence into a direct computation, assuming $ F(n, k) $ reflects these optimizations, the closed-form expression for the minimum",
