  "baseline": "**Step-by-Step Plan:**  \n\n1. **Initial Apples**: Start with the given apples:  \n   $ 156 $ apples.  \n\n2. **Add Apples Received from Shipment**:  \n   Each box contains 24 apples, and there are 3 boxes. Total received:  \n   $ 3 \\times 24 = 72 $.  \n   Updated stock: $ 156 + 72 = 228 $ apples.  \n\n3. **Subtract Sold Apples**:  \n   Morning sale: $ 45 $ apples; Afternoon sale: $ 67 $ apples. Total sales:  \n   $ 45 + 67 = 112 $ apples.  \n   Remaining apples: $ 228 - 112 = 116 $ apples.  \n\n**Final Answer**: The number of apples remaining is **116**.",
