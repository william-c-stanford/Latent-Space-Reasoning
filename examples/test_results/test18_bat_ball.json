  "query": "A bat and ball cost $1.10 together. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? Show your algebraic solution.",
  "baseline": "To solve for the ball's cost, follow these steps using algebra:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:  \n   Let the price of the ball be $ x $. Since the bat is $1.00 more expensive, its price will be $ x + 1.00 $.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations**:\n   - The total cost of the bat and the ball:  \n     $(x + 1.00) + x = 1.10$\n   - Simplify:  \n     $2x + 1.00 = 1.10$\n\n3. **Solve the Equation**:  \n   Subtract 1.00 from both sides:  \n   $2x = 0.10$  \n   Divide by 2:  \n   $x = 0.05$\n\n4. **Final Answer**:  \n   The ball costs **\\$0.05**.  \n\nThus, algebraically, the cost of the ball is found by solving $2x + 1.00 = 1.10$, resulting in $x = 0.05$.",

Since the bat is $1.00 more expensive, its cost will be $ x + 1 $.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equation**:  \n   The total cost of the bat and ball is $1.10. Thus, the equation becomes:\n   $$\n   (x + 1) + x = 1.10\n   $$\n\n3. **Combine Like Terms**:  \n   Simplify the left-hand side:\n   $$\n   2x + 1 = 1.10\n   $$\n\n4. **Solve for $ x $**:\n   Subtract 1 from both sides:\n   $$\n   2x = 0.10\n   $$\n   Divide both sides by 2:\n   $$\n   x = \\frac{0.10}{2} = 0.05\n   $$\n\n5. **Final Answer**:  \n   The ball costs **$0.05**, making the bat cost **$1.05**.  \n\n**Algebraic Solution Summary**:  \n$$\n\\text{Ball Cost} = x = 0.05\n$$",
