  "query": "Person A dies and leaves a will saying 'My estate goes to my children equally.' A has 3 children: B (alive), C (dead, but has 2 children of their own), and D (alive but legally disowned 5 years before death). Under common law per stirpes distribution, who inherits what percentage? What if the jurisdiction uses per capita distribution instead?",
  "baseline": "Here’s a **step-by-step plan** addressing your scenario:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Understanding Legal Framework**\n- **Common Law Per Stirpes Distribution**:  \n  - Property is distributed to closest alive/father/son/wife/equal relative priority.  \n  - If fewer than four heirs survive, additional beneficiaries receive proportionate shares.  \n\n- **Per Capita Distribution**:  \n  - Population-weighted share; less equitable. Not used widely in most jurisdictions.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n#### **(a) Initial Step – Apply Per Stirpes Distribution**\n1. Determine all current survivors at death. In this case:\n   - **Person A**’s children: B (alive), C (dead → includes 2 daughters/d个工作人员), D (disowned).\n   - Only **B** is currently alive. Other children and descendants may inherit post-death.  \n2. Examine heir relationships:  \n   - As a minor (not yet married), *D* (assumed adult?) would inherit.  \n   - *C* died after having two children, meaning his surviving children would also inherit.  \n3. Distribute shares based on order:  \n   - Son gets ½.  \n   - Second sibling shares ⅔.  \n   - Third or fourth beneficiary receives ¼ (if applicable).  \n\n#### **(b) Adjustments Based on Will**\n1. The will states “*my estate goes to my children equally.*” This indicates:  \n   - Children’s rights are treated as equal regardless of existing familial ties.  \n   - Thus, assuming all children (including D and C’s offspring) are eligible, the fair share ratio could shift slightly.  \n\n#### **(c) Addressing Disownment (Optional)**  \n- While *D* was legally disowned, this primarily affects asset claims post-custody rights. Their inclusion in inheritance depends on custody agreement and legal recognition.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Scenario Expansion — Per Capital vs. Per Stirpes Considerations**\n\n- **If Jurisdiction Uses Per Capita Distribution**:  \n  - Calculate overall population for distribution. Example:  \n    - Assume household size = 40 inhabitants. Share allocation = 1/40 × value.  \n  - More equitable across broader populations.  \n\n- **Note**: Common law favors closer kinship over absolute equality. Per stirpes ensures fairness during the period of survival.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary**\n| Factor           | Outcome                                       |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Order of Success | Alive(s)/Dead(everyone)                         |\n| Equal Shares     | Includes all direct descendants (e.g., D, C)      |\n| Will Interpretation | Treats children equally without explicit name    |\n\nThis framework balances statutory priorities with individual intent, ensuring clarity and equity.",
  "latent_reasoning": "Here is a **step-by-step plan** addressing your scenario, incorporating common law per stirpes and potential jurisdictional variations:\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand Immediate Inheritances**\nUnder **common law per stirpes**, heirs receive shares proportional to their lineage:\n- **Child alive**: Equal share.\n- **Children of deceased individuals**: Include them in the distribution.\n- **Direct descendants** (not existing): Not included until they become adults.\n\nFor this case:\n- **Child B (alive)** receives **equal parts** → 50%.\n- **If C survives**, his survivors (including children) are added → potentially more than 50%. \n- **D was deceased but legally dispossessed**, so his share remains unaffected unless confirmed.\n\nAssuming only **B is alive**, and C is deceased, the distribution under *per stirpes* would be:\n\n| Heir   | Share (%) |\n|--------|-----------|\n| B      | 50        |\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Apply Per Capita Distribution Alternative**\nIn **per capita**:\n- Total value of A’s estate is distributed among all rightful heirs, i.e., descendants of B and any co-inhabitants or beneficiaries.\n- This calculation assumes **all properties remain intact** and transfers occur in full.\n\nApplying this:\n- Only B is alive. If A had another sibling, say E, then E would take a larger share.\n- D, being deceased, may also have claims depending on evidence, but typically retains his share.\n\nExample:  \nTotal = $1,000,000  \nB’s portion = $500,000  \n\nPer capita share: $500,000 / 1 = $500,000 (same).\n\nNote: Jurisdiction-specific rules (e.g., whether property is deemed forfeited or not) may override this.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Notes:\n- **Common Law Result:** Under *per stirpes*, 50% goes to B, with C/children contributing via lineage.\n- **Jurisdictional Impact:** Per capita methods adjust shares based on asset values, reducing risks of unequal distribution unless specific transfer restrictions apply. Ensure alignment with local laws regarding ownership and succession.",
