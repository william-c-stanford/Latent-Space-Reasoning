Each can be a knight (who always tells the truth), knave (always lies), or spy (either one could be lying but only one actual person here).\n\nWe know exactly one of them is a knight, one is a knave, and one is a spy. Let me write down what they say:\n\n- A says: \"I am the Spy.\"\n- B says: \"A is telling the truth.\" (So if B is truthful, then A must be the real Spy)\n- C says: \"I am not the Spy.\"\n\nAnd our job is to figure out who is which.\n\nLet me start by considering possible cases where someone else might be the Spy, since that would help eliminate possibilities.\n\nFirst, suppose A is the Spy. Then A says he is the Spy, which matches his statement. Now, check others' statements.\n\nIf A is Spy:\n- Since he's supposed to be the Spy, but actually it depends on whether others are knights/knives.\nBut wait, in reality, there should be exactly one spy. If A is the spy, then maybe B and/or C are different roles. But need more info.\n\nWait, no—the problem states that exactly one of the three is a spy. Wait, but how does being a spy affect their status? Because spies can lie. So perhaps if someone claims something about themselves, they'd be lying. For example, if A is the Spy, then when he says \"I am the Spy,\" that's true because he's indeed the Spy. But if A were a knave, he couldn't make such a statement. Similarly for other positions.\n\nLet me proceed with case 1: Assume A is the Spy.\n\nCase 1a: A = Spy\n\nThen, according to A, he is the Spy → True.\n\nNow, look at B and C's statements.\n\nB says: \"A is telling the truth.\" Well, if A is a Spy, then saying \"truth\" means he's a knight, which contradicts him being aSpy. Therefore, B is making a false statement. Hence, B cannot be a knight; he is a knave.\n\nSimilarly, C says: \"I am not the Spy.\" In Case 1, A is the Spy. So C is claiming he isn't the Spy, which is correct. Therefore, C is telling the truth. Thus, C would be a knight.\n\nSo far, A (spy), B (knave), C (knight) — all distinct. This works! That satisfies the condition—exactly one spy, two knights, one knave.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me verify again.\n\nIn Case 1a:\n\n- A: Spy → His statement holds (says himself).\n- B: Claimed A is honest. Actual scenario: A is Spy, so B's statement is false. Hence, B is knave.\n- C: Claims \"not Spy\", which is true. So C is knight.\n\nYes, that seems valid. So conclusion here is A is Spy, B is Knave, C is Knight.\n\nBut let's test another case just to ensure there aren't any contradictions.\n\nCase 2: Suppose A is a Knight.\n\nSince A is a knight, his statement (\"I am the Spy\") must be true. Therefore, A is indeed the Spy. Which aligns with previous assumption. Then as before, B is knave, C is knight.\n\nThat works too. So regardless of where A starts, assuming he's the Spy leads us to consistent results.\n\nAnother case: Maybe C is the Spy?\n\nSuppose C is the Spy.\n\nC says: \"I am not the Spy.\" But since C is the Spy, this statement is false. Therefore, C's statement is false, which makes sense because he is a Spy (so he lied). \n\nSo now, A and B's statements matter.\n\nCheck B's statement: \"A is telling the truth.\" If B is the knave, then his statement is false. Since B is a liar, A must be lying. However, A was assumed to be a Spy earlier. But if A is a Spy, he would be lying, contradicting his own role. Wait, hold on.\n\nWait, let me redo this part carefully.\n\nCase 3: C is Spy.\n\nThus, C is lying (because he is a Spy).\n\nTherefore, C's statement \"I'm not the Spy\" is false. Which makes sense because he is the Spy.\n\nNow, evaluate B's statement: \"A is telling the truth\". If B is a knave, then his statement is false. Therefore, A is lying.\n\nBut if A is a knight, then his statement (\"I am the Spy\") would mean he is a Spy. Contradiction here, unless...\n\nWait, but in this case, we assumed C is the Spy. So if C is the Spy, then A is either a Knight or Knave, depending on how things go. Wait, but from our initial setup, we know that exactly one is a Knight, one a Knave, one Spy. So if C is the Spy, then the remaining two (A and B) are Knight and Knave.\n\nSo if A is telling the truth (as per knight), then A is the Spy, contradiction because C is also the Spy. Therefore, if C is the Spy, A cannot be a knight. Therefore, A must be the Knave. Therefore, A is lying.\n\nThen, B's statement \"A is telling the truth\" would be false. Hence, B is lying. Therefore, both A and B are liars, implying that the Spy is C. But then, in this case, there's only one Spy (C), matching the conditions. Also, only one Knave (since A and B are lying)—but wait, A is the Knave, B is lying. How many knights are left? We started with exactly one Knight, one Knave, one Spy. Here, C is Spy, and A and B are knaves. Therefore, zero knights? No, wait—if only one Knight exists, then A and B can't both be knaves. Contradiction!\n\nOh! There's a problem here. If C is the Spy, then A and B have to be either Knight/Knave. Since there's one Knight, but we already said that C is the Spy, which leaves A and B needing to be non-Spier (i.e., Knight and Knave). But if A is lying, then he's a Knave, same with B. But that would imply there are no Knights, conflicting with the setup. Hence, this case fails.\n\nWhich suggests that our first assumption (that A is the Spy leading to B being a Knave and C a Knight) is valid, whereas Case 3 is invalid due to inconsistency.\n\nNext case: What if B is the Spy instead? Let's see.\n\nCase 4: Suppose B is the Spy.\n\nSo B is lying, hence his statement \"A is telling the truth\" is false. Therefore, A is not telling the truth, meaning A is a Knave.\n\nNow, check A's statement: \"I am",
